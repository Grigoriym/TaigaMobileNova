# Frictions

Tooling friction hit during work, newest last. One line each. Promoted or fixed entries get
deleted — see `finalize`.

- 2026-08-14: every Renovate PR failed guardrails because the `gradle/libs.versions.toml` wire
  fired on any touch to the file and a bot commit can never carry `Gate-change:`; fixed (ported
  from wallosmobile) by narrowing the wire to `detekt`/`ktlint`/`composeRules`/`agp`/`kover` keys
  only — verified against real commits `9d925e6b` (ksp bump, now passes) and `6f12f291` (detekt
  bump, still correctly fails).
